"code:"
msgstr ""

#: ../developers_advanced.rst:393
msgid ""
"In order to describe constants which are defined by the engine at run, "
"it's necessary to use the ``#var`` special directive. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../developers_advanced.rst:400
msgid ""
"The syntax here is similar to the #define directive. The point of the "
"#var directive is that the value which it defines allows to parse the "
"initial shader. It's irrelevant what exactly it will be (e.g. 'uniform' "
"or 'attribute' in the above example), because at this level it's unknown "
"anyway. Nevertheless, it's better to specify a more or less suitable "
"description and not something arbitrary."
