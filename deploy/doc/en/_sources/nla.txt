Non-Linear Animation
********************


NLA Editor
==========

The Blender's non-linear editor lets us set the scene's behavior in a
comfortable way. With its help we can implement simple scenarios. This
way coding is not needed for simple scenes and applications.

The engine supports controlling the following entities:

* Any animation the parameters of which can be presented with
  Actions

* Audio playback

* Particles emission (in the form of a connection with the global
  timeline)

Usage
-----

1. Activate the "NLA" panel under the "Scene" tab.

2. In the "NLA Editor" set up the required behavior for the scene.

3. Choose the animation time interval on the "Timeline" panel.


Additional settings
-------------------

The *NLA > Cyclic NLA* scene setting activates the cyclic NLA
animation mode.

Note: In order to use vertex animation, enable  "Allow NLA" option
  on the vertex animation panel.


Limitations
-----------

* A simultanious playback of differnet types of animation for the
  same object is not supported.


Controlling via API
===================

Non-linear animation playback can be controlled via API methods of the
"nla.js" module.

   // ...
   var m_nla = require("nla");
   // ...
   m_nla.set_frame(150);
   // ...
   var frame = m_nla.get_frame();
   // ...
   m_nla.play();
   // ...
   m_nla.stop();
   // ...

Please note, that if the Logic Editor is used, the "set_frame",
"play", "stop" methods are not available.
